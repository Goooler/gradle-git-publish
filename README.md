## Why do you care?

Git is immensely popular and being able to interact with it as part of a build process can be very valuable
to provide a more powerful and consistent result.

## What is it?

`gradle-git-publish` is a [Gradle](http://gradle.org) plugin, `org.ajoberstar.git-publish`, which publishes files to a
remote Git repository's branch.

See [Grgit](https://github.com/ajoberstar/grgit) for details on the Git library used underneath, including
configuration for authentication.

## Usage

**NOTE:** gradle-git-publish requires Java 8 (or higher) and Gradle 3.0 or higher.

## Questions, Bugs, and Features

Please use the repo's [issues](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git-publish/issues)
for all questions, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome and are accepted through pull requests.

Smaller changes can come directly as a PR, but larger or more complex
ones should be discussed in an issue first to flesh out the approach.

If you're interested in implementing a feature on the
[issues backlog](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git-publish/issues), add a comment
to make sure it's not already in progress and for any needed discussion.
